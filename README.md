## Examples / Use-Cases / Demo

Example Games that use our integrations:

* [Empires of the Undergrowth](https://www.stomt.com/empires-of-the-undergrowth)      
* [All Walls Must Fall](https://www.stomt.com/AWMF)

## Installation

This repository contains a complete Unreal-Project with the STOMT plugin already integrated. 
Use it as example and integrate the plugin into your game by following the steps below.

_If you use an older Unreal Engine version please check out the `UE/[version]` branch._

1. Clone or download this repository to a folder.

2. Open the project file with Unreal Engine


## Configuration

1. Create a page for your game on [www.stomt.com](https://www.stomt.com/signup/game).

2. Create an [App Id](https://www.stomt.com/integrate) for Unreal.

3. Enter the variables into the `StomtWidgetBP` Blueprint:

* the `App Id` you obtained in the second step
* the `Target Id` of your STOMT project (stomt.com/{Target Id})
* the production `Rest URL`: `https://rest.stomt.com`

**Enter the configuration directly into the `StomtWidgetBP` blueprint**

## Form Triggers

The widget can be opened and closed whenever you want by using our trigger functions.     
    
That allows you to:    
* Put a button into the main menu [(Example)](https://imgur.com/5SoQzfj)
* Put a button into the HUD [(Example)](https://imgur.com/t9wPpJj)
* Only show the button to certain players (e.g. power users)
* Trigger the form after certain events

**Define a hotkey:**

## Event-Callbacks

The STOMT Widget supports a variety of callback events.

## In-Game Labeling

Labels will help you track down user issues.
Append labels, as for example your game-version or the player position/level. You can either hardcode them in the Unity Inspector or use a script to add them in a flexible way based on the information you have.

**Easily add an array of labels**
